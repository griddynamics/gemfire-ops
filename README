This is a set of template scripts to operate Gemfire installation.

bin/gemfire-server and bin/gemfire-locator are legitimate init.d scripts.

Tested on Gemfire 6.5.

ISSUES:
– Configuration files refer to non-existent auth implementations
– probably does not play well with Hyperic...

TODO:
– support for Gemfire JMX agent
– support for upstart?
